            <p>Since its creation, C++ has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Well-written C++
            programs are fast and efficient. The language is more flexible than other languages: It can work at the highest levels
            of abstraction, and down at the level of the silicon. C++ supplies highly optimized standard libraries. It enables
            access to low-level hardware features, to maximize speed and minimize memory requirements. C++ can create almost any
            kind of program: Games, device drivers, HPC, cloud, desktop, embedded, and mobile apps, and much more. Even libraries
            and compilers for other programming languages get written in C++.
            </p>
            <p>One of the original requirements for C++ was backward compatibility with the C language. As a result, C++ has always
            permitted C-style programming, with raw pointers, arrays, null-terminated character strings, and other features. They
            may enable great performance, but can also spawn bugs and complexity. The evolution of C++ has emphasized features that
            greatly reduce the need to use C-style idioms. The old C-programming facilities are still there when you need them.
            However, in modern C++ code you should need them less and less. Modern C++ code is simpler, safer, more elegant, and
            still as fast as ever.
            </p>

            <header>Lexical convention</header>
            <p>This section introduces the fundamental elements of a C++ program. You use these elements, called "lexical elements" or
            "tokens" to construct statements, definitions, declarations, and so on, which are used to construct complete programs.
            The following lexical elements are discussed in this section:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tokens and character sets</li>
                <li>Comments</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Built_in_types">
            <header>Built in types</header>
            <p>Built-in types (also called fundamental types) are specified by the C++ language standard and are built into the
            compiler. Built-in types aren't defined in any header file. Built-in types are divided into three main categories:
            integral, floating-point, and void. Integral types represent whole numbers. Floating-point types can specify values that
            may have fractional parts. Most built-in types are treated as distinct types by the compiler. However, some types are
            synonyms, or treated as equivalent types by the compiler.
            </p>
            
                <ul>
                <li>Void type</li>
                The void type describes an empty set of values. No variable of type void can be specified. The void type is used
                primarily to declare functions that return no values or to declare generic pointers to untyped or arbitrarily typed
                data. Any expression can be explicitly converted or cast to type void. However, such expressions are restricted to the
                following uses:
                <ul>
                <li> An expression statement.</li>
                
                <li>The left operand of the comma operator.</li>
                
                <li>The second or third operand of the conditional operator (? :).</li>
                </ul>
                <li> std::nullptr_t</li>
                The keyword nullptr is a null-pointer constant of type std::nullptr_t, which is convertible to any raw pointer type. For
                more information, see nullptr.
                
                <li>Boolean type</li>
                The bool type can have values true and false. The size of the bool type is implementation-specific. See Sizes of
                built-in types for Microsoft-specific implementation details.
                
                <li>Character types</li>
                The char type is a character representation type that efficiently encodes members of the basic execution character set.
                The C++ compiler treats variables of type char, signed char, and unsigned char as having different types.
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declarations">
            <header>Declarations</header>
            <p>A C++ program consists of various entities such as variables, functions, types, and namespaces. Each of these entities
            must be declared before they can be used. A declaration specifies a unique name for the entity, along with information
            about its type and other characteristics. In C++ the point at which a name is declared is the point at which it becomes
            visible to the compiler. You can't refer to a function or class that is declared at some later point in the compilation
            unit. Variables should be declared as close as possible before the point at which they're used.
            The following example shows some declarations:</p>
            <code>
                int f(int i)<br>
                int main()<br>
                {<br>
                const double pi = 3.14; <br>
                int i = f(2); <br>
                C obj; <br>
                std::string str; <br>
                    j = 0; <br>
                    auto k = 0; <br>
                    }<br>
            
                    int f(int i)<br>
                    {<br>
                    return i + 42;<br>
                    }<br>

            <header>C++ built in operators</header>
            <p>The C++ language includes all C operators and adds several new operators. Operators specify an evaluation to be
            performed on one or more operands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Precedence and associativity
                Operator precedence specifies the order of operations in expressions that contain more than one operator. Operator
                associativity specifies whether, in an expression that contains multiple operators with the same precedence, an operand
                is grouped with the one on its left or the one on its right.</li>
                <li>Alternative spellings
                C++ specifies alternative spellings for some operators. In C, the alternative spellings are provided as macros in the
                iso646.h header. In C++, these alternatives are keywords, and use of iso646.h or the C++ equivalent ciso646 is
                deprecated. In Microsoft C++, the /permissive- or /Za compiler option is required to enable the alternative
                spellings.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Expressions">
            <header>Expressions</header>
            <p>This section describes C++ expressions. Expressions are sequences of operators and operands that are used for one or
            more of these purposes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> Computing a value from the operands.</li>
            
            <li> Designating objects or functions.</li>
            
            <li>Generating "side effects." (Side effects are any actions other than the evaluation of the expression — for example,
            modifying the value of an object.)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In C++, operators can be overloaded and their meanings can be user-defined. However, their precedence and the number of
            operands they take cannot be modified. This section describes the syntax and semantics of operators as they are supplied
            with the language, not overloaded.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
            <header>Statements</header>
            <p>C++ statements are executed sequentially, except when an expression statement, a selection statement, an iteration
            statement, or a jump statement specifically modifies that sequence.
            
            Statements may be of the following types:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>labeled-statement</code></li>
                <li><code>expression-statement</code></li>

            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>A function is a block of code that performs some operation. A function can optionally define input parameters that
            enable callers to pass arguments into the function. A function can optionally return a value as output. Functions are
            useful for encapsulating common operations in a single reusable block, ideally with a name that clearly describes what
            the function does. The following function accepts two integers from a caller and returns their sum; a and b are
            parameters of type int.</p>
            <code>int sum(int a, int b)<br>
            {<br>
            return a + b;<br>
            }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Operator_overloading">
            <header>Operator overloading</header>
            <p>The operator keyword declares a function specifying what operator-symbol means when applied to instances of a class.
            This gives the operator more than one meaning, or "overloads" it. The compiler distinguishes between the different
            meanings of an operator by examining the types of its operands.</p>
            <p>Syntax<br>
            <code> type operator operator-symbol ( parameter-list )</code>
            </p>
            <p>Remarks<br>
            You can redefine the function of most built-in operators globally or on a class-by-class basis. Overloaded operators are
            implemented as functions.
            
            The name of an overloaded operator is operator x, where x is the operator as it appears in the following table. For
            example, to overload the addition operator, you define a function called operator+. Similarly, to overload the
            addition/assignment operator, +=, define a function called operator+=.</p>

            default accessibility is public, whereas in classes the default is private.
            
            Classes and structs are the constructs whereby you define your own types. Classes and structs can both contain data
            members and member functions, which enable you to describe the type's state and behavior.</p>

            <header>Member Access Control</header>
            <p>Access controls enable you to separate the public interface of a class from the private implementation details and the
            protected members that are only for use by derived classes. The access specifier applies to all members declared after
            it until the next access specifier is encountered.</p>
            <p>The default access is private in a class, and public in a struct or union. Access specifiers in a class can be used any
            number of times in any order. The allocation of storage for objects of class types is implementation-dependent. However,
            compilers must guarantee assignment of members to successively higher memory addresses between access specifiers.</p>
